                  <h1>Is it possible to return purchased products?</h1>
                  <p>Away Products is the rightful owner of all products sold on the site, product returns will only be made if the product does not work. In short, if you dont like the product, you cant get a refund (dont doubt that you will like it.)</p>
                  <h1>Can my program be closed by administrators?</h1>
                  <p>Yes, the program can be closed or your access denied by administrators. Our site freezes the time of users when cheating is detected or is in the update phase, so users do not lose time. However, we do this purely based on goodwill. Even if you have purchased the program, if you act incorrectly or inappropriately, your access to the program will be blocked by the administrators and the product will not be returned.</p>
                  <h1>Who makes the cheats and software on the site?</h1>
